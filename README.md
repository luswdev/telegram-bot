# C-3PO 
My practice telegram bot wrote by PHP.

- It can `echo` what you sent.
- Shorten URL from [is.gd](https://is.gd)
- bot.php is my bot class, decode input into `$bot->data`.
- Every execute will record into log file.

---
## Also
It can subscribe [github status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) webhook notifications.

**OR** other statuspage application.
